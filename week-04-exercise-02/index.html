                    Ape Escape 3 is probably one of the best video games on the PS2! Its one of those games I grew up on and still get the urge 
                    to play it on random cold days when i'm feeling nostalgic. Give it a try because it still holds up to time and the music is
                    absoultely beautiful. I can say its my FAV game of all time!

                    This movie is one of the craziest i had ever seen. seeing Mima, the main character, lose her mind and us, the audiance, 
                not actually knowing whats real and whats fake just freaks you out! I think i enjoyed this movie so much since i saw myself so much 
                in mima and it was sad but it had an amazing lesson and great twists. it leaves you at the edge of your seat so PLEASE WATCH IT!!

                    DanceGavinDance is literally my favorite band of all time. This album just changed my brain chemistry and its not my ABSOULTE 
                    favorite album but its the one i started with and so it holds a special place in my heart. I can listen to this album on repeat 
                    and love Rock Solid, arguably the best song on the album lol. I genuinely believe that without DGD I wouldn't have found 
                    my passion for music.

                    These cats mean the absoule world to me. i nurtured them all to health when they were very young and i'm now super attatched to them
                    i mean like attatched to the hip i love my babies and i'm ever so grateful i have them in my life mostly due to hardships i faced
                    that i managed to get through thanks to them. I think taking care of another living being also taught me how to be patient and 
                    responsible and i wouldn't ever have kids but its mostly because i basically already have my own lol.

                    This is one of my Favorite photos of My Bestfriend and I! Although he lives all the way in Nevada he makes the effort to come
                    and visit us once a year. we play video games together all the time though and have known eachotheer since he was 14 and i was 16!
                    he has been with me through thick and thin and i know i can rely on him to play any game, even the crappiest friend slop! also
                    his real name isn't gali it just stuck since that was his user name and he prefers his nick name.

                    This is My Boyfriend that i've been with for about 6 years. We just moved out together but i also think he is my entire world. My cats being
                    number 1 though lol! I believe he truly helped me get better and realize who i was afterr coming from a very terrible relationship 
                    and thanks to his constant encouragement and support i was able to create my own path in life rather than just bounce around with 
                    no meaning. I love my boyfriend so much and love to show off how wonderful he is!
