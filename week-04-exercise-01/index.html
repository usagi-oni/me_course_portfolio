        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="ttu-vandalism.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>i edited one the title of one of the text boxes, the size of the text and the background colors</li>
            <li>i modified the bg colors and the text size</li>
            <li>it was crazy colors and the title was pretty funny stating that "i am a loser"</li>
            <li>I sort of did, it took me a bit to find how to edit the text but once i did i wasn't as lost. </li>
            <li>I chose something simple that i wouldn't hurt my head to edit and i could understand. i think it helped me sort out where what is placed where.</li>
            <li>I was able to understand how they go hand in hand because the HTML is like the building foundation and the css is the archetict making everything look nice.</li>
            <li>I think i do have a better sense. its a little overwhelming but i want to practice a bit more to get a better hang of what to do.</li>
        </ul>
